											<h3 class="major">Honey Bot - PYMUG</h3>
											<p>My first contribution and project while learning python.
											Being in the MSCC (Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community) when I got to know about their PYMUG(Python Mauritius UserGroup) branch and they asked me to try make a simple plugin for their IRC bot project that was mostly for beginners I was really happy to be able to finally put my skills in use. <br>
											Having a background of System Administrator I decided to build a plugin that would return various information on the server running the IRC bot.

											<h3 class="major">Port Scanner</h3>
											<p>Having used Nmap which is one of the most popular Security Scanner, Port Scanner, & Network Exploration Tool.</p>
											<p>We had a problem while scanning all 65,535 ports where nmap would take more than an hour to complete.</p>
											<p>This is why i proposed a simple CLI Port Scanner in which I implemented Multi-Threading which helped scan for open ports in less that 10 seconds.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Email-Automation With Python</h3>
											<p>This project was initially done to help my teacher who was working for Polytechnics Mauritius.<br><br>
											We had a situation where 300 students submitted their assignment that was corrected by our teacher, after that he had to send 1 by 1 each student mark by email to inform them their result.<br><br>
											He was saving all the data in an excel sheet, so i proposed a small script that would read from an excel file and build custom messages that would then be sent to the each students individually. <br><br>
											The Script went great but then the teacher proposed that maybe we should make a GUI version so that the NON-IT literate could also use it. This was then the v2 of my Email-automation Program.<br><br>
											We now have it Open Source for anyone with such situation.
